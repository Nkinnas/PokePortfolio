I want to build a website that tracks the raw (ungraded) market value of Pokémon cards and lets a user manage a simple portfolio of cards they own.

The core idea:

Users can search for a Pokémon card

See its current raw market price and an image of the card

View a line chart of the card’s price history

Add the card to a portfolio/collection

On the portfolio page, see the total value of their collection and percent gain/loss on each card and overall.

Please include at least these core features:

Search & Card View

A search bar where the user can type a card name (e.g. “Charizard”) and see matching Pokémon cards.

For each card in the results, show:

Card image

Card name

Set name

Current raw market price (e.g. in USD)

When a card is clicked, show a card detail page with:

Larger card image

Name, set, card number

Current raw market price

A line chart showing the price history over time for that card.

Basic stats like:

Percent change over a selected period (for example last 30 days)

Lowest and highest price in that period

Portfolio / Collection

The user should be able to add a card to their portfolio from the card detail view.

When adding, let the user input:

Quantity owned

Their purchase price per card

A Portfolio page that:

Lists all cards the user has added, with:

Card image and name

Quantity owned

Purchase price

Current market price

Current total value for that card (quantity × current market price)

Cost basis (quantity × purchase price)

Percent gain or loss and profit/loss in dollars for each card

Shows a summary at the top:

Total current portfolio value

Total cost basis

Overall profit/loss and overall percent change

Price History & Line Chart

For each card, store a simple price history over time (this can be sample or simulated data if real prices are not available).

Use that data to draw a line chart on the card detail page.

Calculate and display percent increase or decrease over the chosen time range using that history.

General UX

The website should be clean and easy to use:

A navigation header with links like “Search” and “Portfolio”.

Clear formatting of money values (e.g. $12.34).

It does not need to handle graded cards (PSA/BGS/etc.) – only raw card values.

If external Pokémon card data is needed (names, sets, images), you can assume the site uses a public Pokémon cards API or sample data, but the main focus should be on:

Searching cards

Showing current raw value + image

Showing price history with a line chart

Managing a portfolio with value and percent change.
